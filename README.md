# Project: For Your Eyes Only

This repository contains a digital Valentine’s surprise. It was built with a specific set of hardware requirements—specifically, a heart that matches mine.

### ⚠️ Access Control Policy
Access to this repository is restricted based on the following logic:

```python
if user == "Varlet":
    print("Welcome! Please proceed to the content below. ❤️")
else:
    print("Access Denied. Please 404 yourself out of here.")
    exit()
